				<h3>PayPal</h3>
				<p>In March 1999, Musk co-founded X.com,
				an online financial services and e-mail
				payment company, with US$10 million from
				the sale of Zip2. One year later, the
				company merged with Confinity, which had
				a money-transfer service called PayPal.
				The merged company focused on the PayPal
				service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.
				PayPal's early growth was driven mainly by
				a viral marketing campaign where new
				customers were recruited when they received
				money through the service. Musk was ousted
				in October 2000 from his role as CEO,
				(although he remained on the board) due to
				disagreements with other company leadership,
				notably over his desire to move PayPal's
				Unix-based infrastructure to Microsoft Windows. 
				In October 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay
				for US$1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk
				received US$165 million.

				<h3>SpaceX</h3>
				<p>In May 2002, Elon founded SpaceX with
				the goal of reducing space transportation
				costs and enabling the colonization of
				Mars. SpaceX has since developed the Falcon
				launch vehicle family and the Dragon
				spacecraft family, which both currently
				deliver payloads into Earth orbit.<br>
				SpaceX's achievements include the first privately funded 
				liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit (Falcon 1 in 2008), 
				the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, 
				and recover a spacecraft (Dragon in 2010), the first private 
				company to send a spacecraft to the International Space 
				Station (Dragon in 2012),[13] the first propulsive landing 
				for an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2015), the first reuse of 
				an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2017), and the first private 
				company to launch an object into orbit around the sun (Falcon
				Heavy's payload of a Tesla Roadster in 2018).

				<h3>Tesla, Inc.</h3>
				<p>Tesla, Inc. (originally Tesla Motors) was incorporated in 
				July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed 
				the company until the Series A round of funding.<br>
				Both men played active roles in the company's early development
				prior to Elon Musk's involvement. Musk led the Series A round 
				of investment in February 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors 
				as its chairman. Musk took an active role within the company 
				and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was 
				not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.<br>
				Following the financial crisis in 2008 and after a series of 
				escalating conflicts in 2007, Eberhard was ousted from the firm. 
				Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect, 
				positions he still holds today. Tesla Motors first built an 
				electric sports car, the Tesla Roadster in 2008, with sales of 
				about 2,500 vehicles to 31 countries. Tesla began delivery of 
				its four-door Model S sedan on June 22, 2012. It unveiled its 
				third product, the Model X, aimed at the SUV/minivan market, on 
				February 9, 2012; however, the Model X launch was delayed until 
				September 2015.</p>
